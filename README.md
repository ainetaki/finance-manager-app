🚀 Installation Guide
Since this app runs on Google's infrastructure, you don't need to install Node.js or set up a server. Just follow these steps:

1. Create the Google Sheet -> Go to Google Sheets and create a new, empty spreadsheet.

Name it whatever you like (e.g., "My Finance 2025").

2. Add the Code
In the spreadsheet, go to Extensions > Apps Script.

Delete any code in the default Code.gs file.

Copy the contents of Code.gs from this repository and paste it into the editor.

Click the + icon next to "Files" and select HTML. Name the file index.

Copy the contents of index.html from this repository and paste it into the new file.

Save the project (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S).

3. Deploy the Web App
In the Apps Script editor, click Deploy (blue button) > New deployment.

Click the gear icon (Select type) next to "Select type" and choose Web app.

Fill in the details:

Authorize Access: Google will ask for permission to access your spreadsheets. Click "Review Permissions", select your account, and if you see a warning screen ("Google hasn't verified this app"), click Advanced > Go to (Untitled Project) (unsafe).
